# A linear regression plugin for Elasticsearch

Linear regression is one of the most well known algorithms in machine learning. It defines a predictive model for the value
of a dependent variable based on a training data set of independent variables when the relationship between the variables can be
described with a linear model. This technique belongs to the supervised learning algorithms in machine learning.

The core idea behind this plugin is to utilize the index data in Elasticsearch during search 
as a linear regression model in order to expose information like

* prediction of a value for the target variable,
* anomaly detection,
* measuring the accuracy or rather predictiveness of the model
* and much more.
